# CS485
Applied Neural Networks

This repository contains all of the code I have created for problem sets in CS485. 

Upon successfully completing the course, Cadets will be able to:

Use artificial neural networks to develop predictive models that are useful for solving complex, real-world problems.
Demonstrate knowledge of a variety of neural network architectures tailored towards specific tasks (computer vision, natural language processing, time-series forecasting).
Implement the universal machine learning workflow to create deep learning models that effectively generalize.
Effectively communicate the application of deep learning to modern problems and identify emerging trends.
